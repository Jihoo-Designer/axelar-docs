# Example: Airdrop! (an end-to-end walkthrough)

Watch Vlad demo an end-to-end walkthrough of our Airdrop example, which sends aUSDC from a source chain to a list of recipients on a destination chain using the callContractWithToken function. The full stack example includes running the examples locally, deploying to testnet, and reviewing analytics tools in testnet... all run with a simple bootstrapped frontend.
